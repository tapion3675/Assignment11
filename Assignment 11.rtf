\f0\fs24 \cf0 Node.js was created by Ryan Dahl in 2009 as a platform built on Chrome\'92 s Javascript runtime. It is intended to help coders build fast and scalable network applications. Its event-driven take on coding allows it to be lightweight and efficient which is perfect for data intensive real-time applications the run across different distibuted services. Node.js does not buffer data but instead loads it in data chunks. It is open source and allows for cross-platform runtime environments for server-side and networking applications.}
